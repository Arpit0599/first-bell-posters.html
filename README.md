I have a clear concept for the four posters from the story "First Bell at Misty Hill School," with specifics on characters, background, and mood for each. The posters need lifelike, DreamWorks/Disney-style visual aesthetics with consistency throughout.

The tools to use are SORA, Imagen 3, and Midjourney, with Midjourney to be used for Posters 1 and 4 (landscape orientation and detailed environments), SORA for Poster 2 (character dynamics), and Imagen 3 for Poster 3 (whimsical playful scene).

Since I cannot directly generate the images, I will draft detailed prompts for each poster for these AI tools: the scene description, characters, environment, style, and key visual details. These prompts will be crafted to ensure consistency in character design, environment, and color palette.

Following the poster prompt creations, I want to present the prompts to you so you can use them in your chosen AI art platforms or I can guide further on their use.

Because the user asked to create the posters "according to this," I will produce a single HTML file as a visual showcase with four image placeholders (using placehold.co with very detailed alt text) and the detailed AI prompt content below each placeholder. This way you get the visual layout and the exact prompts for use with the respective AI art tools.

This approach fits the requirement to have the best visual presentation while providing tool-compatible content, ensuring accurate and consistent artwork creation.

Plan:

Create a single HTML file.
Inside the file, create four poster sections.
Each section includes an image placeholder with a detailed alt describing the intended scene.
Below each image, display the crafted prompt for the respective AI tool with detailed instructions.
Add consistent styling for spacing, fonts, good layout.
Use modern typography and colors that match a clean, inviting UI.
No code or assets for backend or separate files are needed.

Now proceeding to create the complete HTML content with inline styles and scripts (if any needed). The images are placeholders with detailed alt text for AI generation.
